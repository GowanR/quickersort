# Introsort #
This is an implementation of the introsort algorithm.
At its heart, it is a dual-pivot quicksort.
It detects excessive recursion during quicksort and switches to heapsort if need be, guaranteeing O(n log(n)) runtime on all inputs.
For small partitions it uses insertion sort instead of quicksort.

This crate does not depend on `std`, and can be used with `#![no_std]` crates.
It does however depend on `core`.

## Interface ##
The interface is similar to the standard library `sort` and `sort_by` functions.
One difference is that `introsort::sort_by` uses new-style "unboxed" closures for its comparison function.

An example:
```rust
    #![feature(slicing_syntax)]
    #![feature(unboxed_closures)]
    extern crate introsort;

    fn main() {
        let mut ss = vec!["Introsort", "or", "introspective", "sort", "is",
                          "a", "hybrid", "sorting", "algorithm", "that",
                          "provides", "both", "fast", "average",
                          "performance", "and", "(asymptotically)", "optimal",
                          "worst-case", "performance"];
        introsort::sort(ss[mut]);
        println!("alphabetically = {}", ss[]);
        introsort::sort_by(ss[mut], &|a, b| a.len().cmp(&b.len()));
        println!("by length = {}", ss[]);
    }
```

Unlike the standard library sort function, introsort is _not_ a stable sort.

## Performance ##
It is quite fast, outperforming the standard sort on all data sets I have tried.
The performance difference varies depending on the characteristics of the data.
On large, completely random arrays, `introsort` is only 5-10% faster than the standard sort.
However, `introsort`'s performance is greatly improved if the data has few unique values or is (partially) sorted (including reversed data).
For sorted data, `introsort` is ~4-5 times faster, and for data with few unique values it can be more than 20 times faster.
